Implementation of Eigenvector decomposition algorithm (PCA) to classify handwritten digits.

This folder contains:
1. src 		- All source code files
2. plot 	- plots used in the report
3. plot-data	- data used for the plots
4. plot-scripts	- scripts used to plot the data
5. visuals 	- the reconstructed images shown in the report
6. report	- the report

To do a trail sample run of the code:
1. $cd src
2. $octave eigendigits.m

eigendigits.m 		- puts all of the individual components together.
hw2FindEigendigits.m 	- the required file for this assignment (eigen vector decomposition)
knn.m			- the k-nearest neighbour source code

The rest of the code in the src file have names that are self-explanatory and are commented sufficiently to be able to follow the algorithm.

Read report for the explanation of the algorithm, implementation details and results.
